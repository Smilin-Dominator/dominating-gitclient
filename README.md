#### What Is It?
Its a GitClient that I wrote in python, it (most definitely) is not as polished as GitAhead, but it is quit a lot
easier than using Git CLI
#### How To Use It?
- Running the program
  - Windows:
    - Open powershell, `cd` to the DIR that has this and type `./__main__.exe <path_to_directory>`
  - Mac & Linux `./__main__ <path_to_directory>`
- Note:
  - As soon as you start it it'll ask for Codenames, so select a code and add a path.
    - Eg:<br>`code: cod`<br>`path: <path_to_cod_dir>`
    - You may add as many as you like
  - After you set your codenames, you can get to the directories by using `./__main__ <codename>`
  - If you don't have a git repository on the DIR you chose, it'll ask you if you want to initialize one.
#### Functions
- The functions are categorized into multiple categories.
